# TufinQuestions
I've used Java 8 to answer the questions and IntelliJ to run the code 
Question 1 - The code checks for any duplicated characters in sequence and eliminates them. If the longest string is found with no sequentially duplicated letters and all it's characters can be found in the list of characters it is printed
Question 2 - My solution doesn't work but the idea was to create a Set so I could store a unique list of values, add the individual unique values to a list and return the set
Question 3 - I made the digits in the array subtract themselves in order to get to zero and return 1. If the the starting number was zero then it would return 0 meaning it's impossible to get the required result
Question 4 - I used a map to store the words and removed duplicates then printed the first word that appeared
Question 5 - I used a list to store the indices and find the difference between the numbers in the list and printed the smallest value
Question 6 - I split the words, stored them in a map to find their frequencies then got the words with the largest frequencies and stored them in a Tree to return the words in alphabetical order 
Question 7 - I got a list of strings and converted them to nodes. I then had a method for rotating the strings and another to rotate the strings n times and printed the result
